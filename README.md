# csc210-program4

This repo holds shared code for Program 04 in CSC210, Spring 2020.

There are two interfaces that define our undirected graphs: **Graph210** and **Edge210**.

The **GraphHelper** class suggests a couple of static methods you might entertain.

thanks...yow, bill

## graphs folder

Graph files and results are located in the **graphs folder**.

My starter graphs are test0.txt through test3.txt. 
The number indicates the number of vertices in the graph.
These tiny graphs are great to initially test new code.

I have copied some of Sedgewick's example from https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/43mst/.

+ tinyEWG.txt - the 8 vertex example Sedgewick shows in his book
  + tinyEWG_prims_mst.txt - my Prim's solution to tinyEWG
  + tinyEWG_sedgewick_prims_mst.txt - Sedgewick's Prims's solution to tinyEWG
+ mediumEWG.txt - Sedgewick's 250 vertex example
  + medium_prims_mst.txt - my Prim's solution
+ 1000EWG.txt - Sedgewick's 1,000 vertex example
  + 1000EWG_prims_mst.txt - my Prim's solution
+ 10000EWG.txt - Sedgewick's 10,000 vertex example
  + 10000EWG_prims_mst.txt - my Prim's solution

I did **not** copy Sedgewick's BIG daddy...
+ largeEWG.txt - "contains one million vertices and 7,586,063 edges"

I leave that one to you. (ha)
